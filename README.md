# IEU_Computer_Programming

Submissions for Computer Programming 2024 for Sebastian Perilla

To test out each submission please `cd` into the appropriate folder and run the following commands:

### CMake

```
mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

ctest

```


- This should run the relevant tests for each submission (also no zipbomb I think)



### Doxygen 

```
cd src

doxygen Doxyfile
```

- All the relevant documentation will be created at the root under the directory name `/docs`
